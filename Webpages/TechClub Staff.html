		<h2><ins style="color: #676767;">Questions</ins></h2>
		
		<p>
			<b><ins>Will I be kicked out of tech club if I don’t come often?</ins></b><br>
				Although we really value attendance, you will not be kicked out if you do not attend 
				very often. People who have perfect attendance get rewards on the last day.

				<br><br>

			<b><ins>Can we eat during Tech Club?</ins></b><br>
				Sine we are handling tech and trying to focus on hard activities in short periods
				 of time, eating is not allowed.

				<br><br>

			<b><ins>Is Tech Club Fun?</ins></b><br>
				Depends on your definition of Fun, if it means to learn new things, make new 
				friends and explore areas of possible careers then yes, tech club is fun!

				<br><br>

			<b><ins>Do I have to do the activities that are planned every time of tech club?</ins></b><br>
				It is encouraged to follow the activities that are planned, but if you would like 
				to explore further, then for sure, here at Tech Club we encourage development, so 
				go wild, program a javascript game on the first day!

				<br><br>

			<b><ins>If the club is full (No more computers are available in the room) can I still join?</ins></b><br>
				Unfortunately, we would like to keep everyone in one place so no, but if we get enough
				 people that want to join while the club is full, we can have tech club in the library 
				 on the days they allow us to. 
				 
				<br><br> 

			<b><ins>Will we be doing any hardware work in tech club?</ins></b><br>
			Yes, around mid year we will be experimenting with circuit boards, and learning about 
			transistors, resistors, capacitors, and chocks. We will also get a bit into robotics if 
			the library is able to support us.
			
				<br><br> 

			<b><ins>Will we ever take longer than an hour?</ins></b><br>
			Maybe, sometimes we might have a very heavy topic to cover so we might take longer than
			 an hour (python and java intros).
			
				<br><br> 
			
			<b><ins>Will we be aware of possible computer careers after this?</ins></b><br>
			Yes, as we finish certain topics we will look at what careers are pursuable if 
			you are interested in them!
			
						<br><br> 

			<b><ins>Can we play computer games in Tech club?</ins></b><br>
			No, since we use up our time to plan and make activities for you, the students, we
			will not allow you to play computers games during tech club, you can do that at home,
			tech club is a place you come to develoup your skills and learn something new and 
			intresting, it's not a time to play games, it's a time to develoup and make new friendships.
			 
			 			<br><br> 

			<b><ins>Can my friends that don't attend STA come to tech club?</ins></b><br>
			Unfortunately, no acording to school rules we canot host events for people outside of 
			school without paying the school for "rent" of the space, so for tech club to be free for 
			STA students, Tech club will only be for STA students.
			
						<br><br> 

			<b><ins>Do we have to enroll into a tech cource if we attend tech club?</ins></b><br>
			No, even though we make you aware of tech cources and careers, you're not obligated to 
			take a tech cource in your heightschool carrer, even though basically all big companies 
			are saying students need to at least learn coding in heightschool, you don't have to.
